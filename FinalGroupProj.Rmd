5.10 (a) Fit CAPM for the period (i) from Jan 1994 to June 1998 (ii) from Jul 1998 to Dec 2006 and estimate beta

The estimated betas significantly differ for the two specified periods. In practice, beta is the measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of an individual stock in comparison to the unsystematic risk of the entire market. This results show that the systematic risks for the two periods respectively differ a lot. Statistically speaking, beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points from a stock's returns against those of the market. This can be seen from the plots illustrated above. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
